Temporally, the transition is only constrained to fall within the Seiderocheka-Polisarka succession (2501.5 to 2434.9 Ma); the additional age constraint from the intervening Seidorechka Volcanic Formation does not help to constrain the transition timing due to the absence of sulfur data in this interval. 

Note that these data demonstrate that the MIF-MDF transition occurs prior to (stratigraphically beneath) the oldest Paleoproterozoic glaciation, which is recorded by the glacigenic upper Polisarka Sedimentary Formation. 

The inferred age of d13C observations within this succession may help to more tightly constrain the timing of the glaciation, which occurs above the d13C observations, and can be linked to both the MIF and MDF observations at the formation level. Because the d13C data do not span the full interval (and are more stratigraphically restricted than the S isotope data within each formation), correlation will not help to constrain the MIF-MDF transition timing.
