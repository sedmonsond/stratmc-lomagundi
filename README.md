This repository contains the data and code required to reproduce the figures and analyses in Edmonsond & Dyer (in review). 
  
 The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory can be used to re-run the inference model or load the inference results from the manuscript. To load our results, download the `traces` archive from Zenodo (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15460760>) (also available as assets attached to this repository's latest release) and extract it to the ``notebooks`` folder. 
 
 To run the code, the Python package [StratMC](https://stratmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) also must be installed on your machine. StratMC can be installed using the PyPI package installer (`pip install stratmc`). For more detailed installation instructions, see the [package documentation](https://stratmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
